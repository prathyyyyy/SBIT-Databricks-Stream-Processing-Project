# SBIT-Databricks-Stream-Processing-Project

## 1. Introduction:

The SBIT dataset project, akin to data collected by Apple or Samsung watches, involves tracking user metrics such as distance covered, calories burned, and various gym-related and general information. Implemented using Databricks, Spark Streaming, and Kafka, this project employs both stateless and stateful streaming transformations. Key features include data lineage and governance via Unity Catalog, windowing aggregates, watermarking for state cleanup, and streaming joins and aggregation, with a focus on efficiently handling memory issues during streaming joins. Additionally, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are managed using Azure DevOps.
